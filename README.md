# Graphing Your Way Through the Cosmos

![Graphing Your Way Through the Cosmos](https://chadgreen.blob.core.windows.net/slides/GraphingYourWayThroughTheCosmos%20-%20Thumbnail.jpg)

## Abstract
Data as it appears in the real world is naturally connected, but traditional data modeling focuses on entities which can cause for complicated joins of these naturally connected data.  That is where graph databases come in as they store data more like what happens naturally in the real world.  Sure, there a lot of talk about using graph databases for social networks, recommendation engines, and Internet of Things; but using graph databases can also make a lot of sense when working with common business data problems.
In this presentation, you will get a better understanding of what graph databases are, how to use the Gremlin API within Azure Cosmos DB to traverse such data structures and see practical examples to common data problems.

## Short Abstract
Data is naturally connected, but data modeling focuses on entities which cause complicated joins; this is where graph databases come in as they store data more naturally. See how to use Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API to traverse such data structures and see practical examples to common data problems.

## One Sentence Abstract
Data is naturally connected, but data modeling focuses on entities which cause complicated joins; during this presentation you will find out how graph databases can model common data problems better.

## Why Should You Attend
Do you wish there was a better way to organize your related data?  The big secret is that relational databases actually are not that good storing related data (without complicated joins and such).  Graph databases do a much better job of organizing data in way that is powerful for developers but simple enough for executives to understand.  In this session you will learn what graph databases are, how Azure Cosmos DB implements them, and see a real-world example of the differences between a graph database and a relational database.
